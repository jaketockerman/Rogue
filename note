     - Name in CreatureAction/their implementations?

Todo:
     - Dungeon toString 
     - Parser


Stand alone classes:

Dungeon             ObjectDisplayGrid


Hierarchy classes:


                               Displayable 


            /               /                  \                   \ 
        Structure        Creature              Item               Magic
        /      \          /    \             /      \   \
      Room    Passage  Player Monster      Scroll  Armor  Sword 


                               Action 
               /                                          \
            CreatureAction                              ItemAction

Design update:
-> Singleton design pattern for Dungeon and ObjectDisplayGrid
-> ArrayList for room, creature, passage, item, PosX, PosY, CreatureAction, ItemAction
-> Action should be something similiar to Stragegy pattern, and be put in each creature
-> Players can only have armor and sword
-> Monster can have armor 

Dungeon will have name, width, topHeight, gameHeight, bottomHeight
     Rooms will have items, players or monsters
          Item 
     Passage 



Step 2 

Goal:
display the dungeon and control player movement

-> treat asciipanel code as black box
-> 


Step 3
Goal:
Changed implementations


display playerHP, core on top Display (done)
display Pack: and info: on bottom Display (done)
? character display help message (done)
press H <next input character> display what the character will do 
press E <next input character> if <next input char> is Y or y, then the game is ended (done)
Display item in the pack (done)

hit the monster and display creature action, if Hp is less than 0, end the game
pick up and drop the item
